Crossings :: Numbers 22 - Balaam and his Donkey

BACKGROUND:
---
Israel moved into the land of Moab after defeating the Amorites and the King of Og. The people of Moab knew the reputation of the Israelites and were "filled with dread" because they feared the Israelites would consume all the natural resources of their land. 

Balak (son of the king) is concerned about the future of the land that he is going to be inheriting from his father, so he decides to contact Balaam, a well-known, non-Israelite diviner (though in some way knows the God of the Israelites) of the time with the following message:

**Read 22:5-6**
Behold, a people has come out of Egypt. They cover the face of the earth, and they are dwelling opposite me. Come now, curse this people for me, since they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”

Balak sends messengers to Balaam with the "fee of divination" and Balak's message. After hearing the message, Balaam invites the messengers to stay while he speaks with the Lord. 

God's message to Balaam is that he should not go. The messengers leave to tell Balak who doesn't like it and thinks he can persuade Balaam with promises of honor and anything he asks, if he would just curse the Israelites (use of evil principalities and powers)

Balaam then speaks with God regarding whether of not he should go with them. This time, God says he should go with them, but only do what I tell you to do.

**Read 22:20**
And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise, go with them; but only do what I tell you.” So Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.

Even though God allows Balaam to go with the men from Moab, His anger is kindled and sends the angel of the Lord to "stand in the way as his adversary"

BALAAM AND HIS DONKEY:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Balaam is riding along, his donkey suddenly swerves to avoid protect Balaam from the sword of the angel of the Lord. Balaam does not understand why his donkey is swerving so he beats his donkey three separate times on three separate occasions. 

After the third instance of being struck, God opened up the mouth of the donkey, and she spoke to Balaam, asking why he was hitting her, she has a lifetime of good rice to him and has never done anything that would intentionally hurt him. Balaam can only agree with her because he knows she's right. 

God then opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angel of the Lord, who says, 

**Read 22:32-35**
And the angel of the Lord said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me. The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live.” Then Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.” And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.

Balaam repents as he now understands that the donkey was there to protect him from the angel of the Lord, and they all continue on their journey back to Moab. The angel of the Lord reminds Balaam of the requirement from God, "speak only the word that I tell you."

# SPIRITUAL BATTLE:
---
There are a few spiritual battles here:
- the one in Balaam's heart in being persuaded by money and honor
- the angel of the Lord coming and trying to kill Balaam because "his way is perverse".
- the belt of truth - Balaam speaks the truth from the Lord regardless of what Balak paid him to say (eph 6:14)
- the spiritual world is active in the physical world, even when we can't see it occurring.

# INTERESTING NOTES:
---
God sends the angel of The Lord but also protects Balaam via the donkey swerving to avoid the angel's sword

## God showing His power:
* God knows everything that's going to happen from the beginning of the story. 
* God knows Balaam's heart is not after His and is more interested in his own personal gain, not in doing God's will.
* God knew Balaam would be persuaded by the wealth, honor, and power that the messengers from the second trip would bring. Balaam allowed his ego to get in the way of following God, and God knew that would happen.
* God allowed the donkey to protect Balaam from the angel that was sent by God to kill Him. 
* God allowed the donkey to see the angel. 
* God allowed the donkey to speak (say what?!). 
* God allowed Balaam to see the angel. 
* God allowed Balaam to continue on to Moab.
